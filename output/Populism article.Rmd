# The sound of anti-elite: Regional accents, charisma and populism

## 1. Introduction:


# 2. Theoretical consideratoin

* Tajfel: In and outgroup,
* Social Identity Theory of Leadership (Hogg et al): Charisma as positive attribute of leader, leader most likely individual who is perceived to be prototypical members of ingroup.
* definition of populism and link to in- and outgroup
* previous socioling. Studies on listeners’ perception of speaker as part of their in and outgroup based on regional accent and standard language.  
* regionalism and populism 


**Hypothesis:** 
Populist attitudes will moderate negative bias towards regional accent of speakers regarding their perceived charisma. Direction: The weaker individuals populist attitudes the more negative they will implicitly judge speakers’ perceived charisma in their regional accent.   

# 3.	Methodology: 

## 3.1.	Applications of the IAT

We conducted Implicit Association Tests (IAT) to measure charisma judgements and test our hypothesis {Greenwald, 2022 #644;Greenwald, 1998 #1008}. IATs are established measures of implicit evaluations which require little cognitive load as well as little time and is therefore thought to tap into automatic cognitive processes {De Houwer, 2007 #1169;De Houwer, 2009 #960}. Studies argue various advantages of implicit evaluation measures, among them their low malleability as well as their high predictive value regarding habitual and automatic behaviour especially in socially sensitive contexts {Greenwald, 2009 #1341;Dovidio, 2002 #1343}. More specifically, low malleability of judgements results from participants being mainly unaware of the workings of the IAT experimental paradigm preventing them to consciously alter their reactions in IATs and thus bias their evaluations in a socially desirable direction {Blair, 2002 #977;Fiedler, 2005 #973}. 
A plethora of studies in political psychology apply IATs exploring implicit attitudes and link them to voting decisions and policy preferences on for example migration and environmental issues {Arcuri, 2008 #811;Brick, 2018 #815;Friese, 2007 #1002;Friese, 2016 #810;Jost, 2019 #812;Gawronski, 2015 #813;Pérez, 2010 #814}. Numerous studies measure implicit attitudes towards parties and their candidates {Arcuri, 2008 #811;Friese, 2007 #1002}. Other studies however measure implicit attitudes towards ethnic outgroups as well individuals’ implicit social identity and then explore how well these implicit judgments predict voting decisions and policy preference {Pérez, 2010 #814;Brick, 2018 #815}. Studies present conflicting evidence whether implicit attitudes are better predictors of political behaviour such as voting decisions than explicit attitudes measured with questionnaires {Gawronski, 2015 #813;Jost, 2019 #812;Kurdi, 2019 #818}. The debate around the predictive value of implicit attitudes in political contexts revolves especially around predicting voting behaviour of undecided voters {Arcuri, 2008 #811}. Overall, researchers agree that implicit judgements contribute to the prediction of voting behaviour in general {Kurdi, 2019 #818;Jost, 2019 #812;Gawronski, 2015 #813}. IAT studies on implicit judgments in the political sphere are conducted online as well as under lab conditions and they mainly use visual stimuli such as words or pictures {Arcuri, 2008 #811;Brick, 2018 #815;Kurdi, 2019 #818}. 
The present study’s IAT measures linguistic biases in speakers’ perception as charismatic. Numerous studies in (social-)linguistics applied IATs to measure how speakers of various language varieties are perceived in different socio-political and geographical contexts {Pantos, 2012 #950;Rosseel, 2018 #962;Ianos, 2020 #1456;Weirich, 2020 #1588}. Participants in these IAT studies were presented stimuli in various modalities, including verbal and non-verbal auditory stimuli {Anikin, 2019 #1219;Lehnert, 2019 #987;Pantos, 2012 #950;Vande Kamp, 2002 #1112}. Studies on speaker perception argue that implicit language attitudes are less impacted by social desirability and thus are better predictors for individuals’ own language use, since language behaviour mainly habitual and automatic {Rosseel, 2019 #1457;Vari, 2020 #1422}. 
Accordingly, the present study’s application of the IAT methodology was motivated by considerations of socially desirability as well predictive value for habitual behaviour. IATs are more likely to establish linguistic biases in politicians’ charisma perceptions compared to direct measures of explicit charisma judgments with questionnaires. In addition, we suggest that IATs explore automatic perceptions of politicians’ language usage which might be more indicative of listeners’ habitual engagement with these politicians such as listening to speeches and debates.   


## 2.2.	The workings of the IAT experimental paradigm

The IAT experimental paradigm measures the strength of the association between two categories, namely one target category and one attribute category. The magnitude of how strongly participants associate target and attribute category is taken to be indicative of participants’ implicit evaluations. More specifically, participants perform two alternating categorisation task which requires them to sort stimuli of each category as fast and accurate as possible by key press into two subcategories of either the target or the attribute category. The target category of the present IAT experiment was “language variety” with the subcategories being standard variety, i.e. Hochdeutsch, and the non-standard, vernacular variety.
In addition, the present study’s IATs contained as the attribute category perceived leadership style of politicians which was further divided into the two subcategories “with charisma” and “without charisma”. Overall, the present study asked participants to categorise stimuli into four subcategories, namely “vernacular”, “standard variety”, “with charisma” and “without charisma”. 

The fulcrum of any IAT is the mapping of the two keys to perform the categorisation tasks. Each attribute subcategory is combined with each target subcategory on one of the two keys in different blocks. For example, the target subcategory “standard variety” was combined on the same key once with the leadership attribute “with charisma” and once with leadership attribute “without charisma”. Similarly, target subcategory “vernacular” was combined once with the leadership attribute “with charisma” and once with leadership attribute “without charisma”. The key mapping that results in participants categorising stimuli faster and more accurately is to be taken as the strongest association in participants’ minds. This specific association between the target category “language variety” and attribute category “leadership style” is then considered to be participants’ evaluation of the target, i.e. language variety, regarding the attributes, i.e. with or without charisma, provided. 

## 2.3.	Participants

Participants were paid 5 (???) [Stückpreis 5 € auf bilendi Rechnung, aber woher weiß wie viel davon pp payment?] Euros for one session which lasted approximately 30 minutes and they were recruited using the platform bildendi. A total of 737 participants took part in the study but 121 participants had to be excluded following standard data cleaning procedures for IATs {Greenwald, 2022 #644}, see also X.X. Results. A further 36 participants were excluded since they reported early childhood exposure to Swabian in the linguistic background questionnaire, see 2.5. Procedure. This early childhood exposure to Swabian, i.e. the stimuli speakers’ vernacular in this study’s IAT, was likely to lead to an ingroup bias towards the vernacular speech. Such an ingroup bias based main caretakers’ linguistic identity in early childhood could potentially confound this papers’ research questions regarding a different in- and outgroup construction based on elite and anti-elite perceptions. 

Overall, the final sample included 538 participants (290 female, 247 male, 1 divers) with an average age of 46 years (s.d. = 16.4) ranging from 18 years to 83 and thus being representative of the German population. Similarly, the distribution of federal states and education was also mainly representative of the overall population of Germany with a slight skew towards higher education (350 individuals with A-levels or similar educational attainment). 

## 2.4.	Materials

### 2.4.1.	Speakers

All stimuli of the IAT were presented in auditory modality, since we aimed to avoid issues regarding participants’ lack of familiarity with vernaculars in written modality. Auditory stimuli were created by six speakers (3 male and 3 female, mean age: 32 years; s.d. = 3.22 years, range: 29 - 37 years) who all obtained higher education degrees (3 PhDs, 2 MA, 1 BA). All speakers were able to produce the standard variety, i.e. Hochdeutsch, as well as a non-standard, vernacular variety, namely Swabian. Speakers reported to have had at least one main caretaker in early childhood to be Swabian speaker as well as to have spent the majority of their childhood in the Swabian vernacular region. In the present study, Swabian was taken to be representative of vernacular varieties in general and especially in contrast to standard German. Swabian is one of the most well-known and easily identifiable vernacular varieties in Germany which is also evaluated fairly neutral compared to for example polarised judgments of Bavarian and Saxonian {Adler, 2020 #137}. Such relatively balanced evaluations are likely to foster the representativeness of this variety for the mental category vernacular variety in participants’ minds. 
In general, speakers who are using their vernacular variety frequently and competently tend to be older males with lower SES living in rural areas in Germany {Plewnia, 2012 #1435}. The young age group and high socio-economic status of our speakers made it likely that they were also able to produce Standard German without regional accent.
Finally, we explored the perception of our speakers in a small-scale norming study. 44 informants of online study rated all speakers to be authentic speakers of the respective language variety (vernacular as well as standard) on a Likert scale from 1 till 4 (standard mean: 2.65, s.d. in  = 0.99; vernacular: 2.97, s.d. = 0.86). 

Recording sessions were remunerated with 30 € per session mainly took place at the University’s lab in a sound-attenuated recording booth containing a MXL 990, condensor microphone. Sessions lasted approximately one hour, since stimuli for other experiments were recorded in addition to the stimuli reported here. Depending on the category, stimuli were either recorded with a picture naming task (language variety) or with written word list (leadership style attributes). All recordings were equalised in amplitude and adjusted in length using audio editing software. The final stimuli consisted of one or two syllable words which were in average XXX ms long (s.d./ range). 

### 2.4.2. Target stimuli

Target stimuli are exemplifiers of the target category, i.e. language variety. We selected thirty-one potential words which previous studies identified to be likely to elicit lexical as well as phonetic differences between standard German and Swabian {Klausmann, 1997 #652;Fischer, 2012 #653}. In this first selection, we attempted to ensure that all stimuli words were of neutral emotional valence by checking emotion ratings in two corpora {Lahl, 2009 #419;Võ, 2009 #416}. The final six stimuli words were selected from twenty-one recorded words based on speakers’ consistency in producing lexical and phonetic differences between the standard and the vernacular variety. Overall, the IAT included six stimuli words produced by six different speakers in two language varieties, resulting in 72 auditory target stimuli. The final six stimuli words can be found in the table 1 as well as on OSF as audio versions.

### 2.4.3. Attribute stimuli

Besides the target category, the experimental paradigm of IATs also includes the attribute category and attribute stimuli. The attribute category provides the attributes with which the target category is potentially associated, most commonly emotional valence, i.e. “positive” vs. “negative” {Rosseel, 2022 #1603}. However, the target category can be combined with any attribute category, and thus also explore the content of mental representations of social groups  such as “working class” vs. “middle class” {Campbell-Kibler, 2012 #958}. In the present IAT, the attribute category represents the perceived leadership style of politicians “with charisma” and “without charisma”. Following {Greenwald, 2022 #644@@author-year} recommendations, we aimed to ensure that the attribute stimuli were on the one hand, not confounded by emotional valence and on the other hand, sufficiently representative of the attribute category. 
In their extensive review of the IAT paradigm, {Greenwald, 2022 #644@@author-year} critique application of IATs exploring for example content of (gender) stereotypes with attribute stimuli such as “strong” vs. “weak” which are also of opposing emotional valence. In the present study, we avoided to confound our measures with emotional valence by first, choosing the subcategory label “without charisma” in opposition to “with charisma”. The subcategory label “without charisma” was less likely to evoke negative associations compared to the negation “uncharismatic”, especially together with the narrative of good politicians who are different in their leadership styles. Most importantly, all attribute stimuli were of positive emotional valence, including the subcategory politicians “without charisma”.   

In addition, we ensured that attribute stimuli were sufficiently representative of the attribute category in order to facilitate their categorisation by participants. Previous studies provide attributes of charismatic personalities in English, Italian, French and Arabic {Biadsy, 2008 #174;D'Errico, 2013 #632;Signorello, 2020 #370;Signorello, 2012 #693;Rosenberg, 2009 #195}. However, these attributes were found to be partially cultural context dependent {Biadsy, 2008 #174} and to date no study explored the semantic correlates of charisma in the cultural context of the present study, i.e. Germany. In order to establish representative stimuli for our attribute category “leadership style”, we ran an exploratory study (n = 116) with open questions asking participants to describe charismatic personalities in German. These attributes of charismatic personalities were combined with translations of semantic correlates of charisma from previous studies {Biadsy, 2008 #174;Rosenberg, 2009 #195;D'Errico, 2013 #632;Signorello, 2012 #693}. In addition, we added positive attributes of employees in general as well as *transactional* leaders who are thought to be the opposite of *transformational*, charismatic leaders in leadership and management studies {Bass, 1999 #390;Bass, 1985 #480;Rothfelder, 2012 #339}. The norming study of speaker perception piloted also our attribute list. Overall, these procedures resulted in twenty representative attributes of the attribute category “leadership style, see table X.

```
These twenty attribute stimuli were recorded in two language varieties, i.e. Swabian and Standard German, by six speakers (described in X.x. Speakers), resulting in forty phonetically different stimuli per speaker.   
Overall, 240 auditory attribute stimuli were part of the IAT experiment included. However, the experiment set up included an individualised selection out of the twenty attributes as well as a between participant design for the factors speaker gender as well as language variety of attribute stimuli, see X.x. procedure. This design led to participants being only presented twelve auditory attribute stimuli in the IAT.

## 2.5.	Procedure

The online study was programmed in Python and JavaScript and was run with JATOS {Lange, 2015 #1163} on the Mindprobe Server {LindenLoot,  2021-2024 #809}. The study was conducted completely in German and consisted of three parts: attribute selection and practice, the IAT experiment and an extensive questionnaire. 

The motivation of including a pre-experimental part in which participants selected their final attribute stimuli and practiced their selection was three-fold: First, we were not aware of any previous research on charisma correlates in the German context. In addition, our exploratory and norming study showed high degrees of variation in leadership style attributes and crucially, meta-analyses of the IAT paradigm emphasize the importance of an effortless categorisation of stimuli in IATs (REF Greenwald). Individualised IATs including personalised selections of stimuli have been previously applied successfully in various research fields {Olson, 2004 #808;Greenwald, 2022 #644;Rosseel, 2018 #962}. 
Personalisation of stimuli took place in the present study’s attribute selection phase before the IAT. In the selection phase, participants were instructed to recall politicians who they thought to be “good politicians” and how to best describe them. Twenty leadership style attributes (section X.x., table x.x.) were presented as visual stimuli completely randomised in one input list. Each attribute from the input list had to be allocated to one of the two selection lists, namely the subcategories “politicians with charisma” and “politicians without charisma” and ranked based on their typicality. Participants had the opportunity to review their allocation, before practicing the categorisation of the six most highly ranked attributes for each group. In order to practice their selection, participants sorted the top twelve attributes into the leadership subcategories by clicking on the respective label “with charisma” and “without charisma”. The labels were presented completely randomised at the top and the bottom of the screen. Attributes were visually presented as single words in the middle of the screen in a pseudo-randomised order by ensuring a change of subcategory every 3rd trial. Participants had to complete a minimum of 3 practice rounds with an accuracy of 80 % in the final trial to proceed to the next part of the study. Otherwise, they completed additional practice rounds (up to 7 rounds) to achieve a similarly accurate performance of 80% in their final round.   

The attribute practice and selection phase was followed by Auditory Implicit Association Test (IAT) including only audio stimuli, namely the target stimuli of section X.x as well as the audio versions of the twelve written attributes from the pre-selection phase. 
Participants were randomly assigned to four different study conditions, either listening to a male or female speaker as well as either being presented leadership attributes in Standard German or the vernacular variety. We opted to also randomise the language variety in which leadership attributes were produced in order to counterbalance a potential bias towards Standard German based on mere exposure. 

In the main IAT experiment, participants were asked to sort target auditory stimuli into the categories  ‘standard’ and ‘vernacular’, as well as attribute auditory stimuli “with charisma and without charisma” as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing designated keys on the keyboard. The key mappings were indicated on top of the screen. The labels indicating the categories were “Hochdeutsch” (standard German) versus “Dialekt” (vernacular) for the target category language variety as well as “mit Charisma” (with charisma) versus “ohne Charisma” (without charisma”) for the attribute category. We opted to not label the vernacular variety specifically as Swabian since we wanted to elicit participants’ mental representations of vernacular varieties in general opposed to the standard variety. 
The stimuli appeared in the middle of the screen as either blue or orange coloured pictogram indicating sound (a loudspeaker). The colour of the loudspeaker corresponded to the colour of the respective category label in order to facilitate the categorisation, see figure X.   

```{r exampl_screen_IAT, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Example screen of IAT combined block"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("output", "Screen_shot_IAT.png"))

# add label to cross reference figure
```
We measured participants’ accuracy (correct/incorrect) and reaction time (RT) in milliseconds for each stimulus categorisation. Participants received continuous feedback in form of a red cross indicating a false categorisation after an erroneous trial.   

Overall, our IAT followed the standardised experimental design (REF Greenwald et al  and had accordingly seven blocks with differences in amount of trials (20, 30 or 40 trials). Similarly, blocks differed regarding categories (only attribute category, only target category, or both) and key mapping (type of category mapped on left key and right key). The pivotal part of the IAT design is the switch of the key mapping after block 4 for the target stimulus categories, i.e. ‘standard or vernacular’, while the ‘with charisma/ without charisma” mapping remains constant. Different block orders aimed to counterbalance order effects adding two further conditions to the previously described four study conditions. To summarise, the present study’s IAT had a 2 (speaker gender) x 2 (language variety of attributes) x 2 (block orders) between participants design. For an overview of the block orders see table X:
```{r table_study_condition}

study_block1 <- data.frame (blockno. = 1:7, 
                            left_key_E = c('standard', 'with charisma', 'standard & with charisma', 'standard & with charisma', 'vernacular', 'vernacular & with charisma', 'vernacular & with charisma'),
right_key_I =c('vernacular', 'without charisma', 'vernacular & without charisma', 'vernacular & without charisma', 'standard', 'standard & 
without charisma', 'standard & without charisma'))

study_block2 <- data.frame (blockno. = 1:7, 
                            left_key_E = c('vernacular', 'with charisma', 'vernacular & with charisma', 'vernacular & with charisma', 'standard', 'standard & with charisma', 'standard & with charisma'),
right_key_I =c('standard', 'without charisma', 'standard & 
without charisma','standard & 
without charisma', 'vernacular', 'vernacular & without charisma', 'vernacular & without charisma'))

# show both tables side by side
```
After the IAT, participants completed an extensive questionnaire beginning with a question regarding their awareness of experimental paradigm so that potentially biased charisma judgements could be excluded from analysis {Agosta, 2011 #1111;Blair, 2002 #977;Fiedler, 2005 #973}. Furthermore, participants reported general demographic information such as age, gender, education and income. Additionally, three open questions established participants’ current exposure to various language varieties as well as their exposure in their childhood by main care takers.   

Two questions enquired after participants party affiliation and their political ideology measured on a contentious scale from left to right. Most importantly, we measured with four questionnaire items participants’ populist attitudes, see section x.x. Finally, nine items of the Crowe- Marlowe Social Desirability Questionnaire established how likely participants’ answers were socially biased {Crowne, 1960 #739;Stöber, 1999 #742;Vésteinsdóttir, 2017 #736}. 

## 3.	Results

### 3.1. Data cleaning 
Standard data cleaning procedures for IAT (REF Greenwald et al.) ensure participants engagement with the experiment by excluding all data from participants who have more than 10% of their trials less than 300ms as well as excluding individual trials above 10,000 ms. 121

Excluded practice blocks 1,2,5

Treatment of error trial response time: replaced RTs for error trials with participants' mean of correct responses plus 600 ms as penalty.
